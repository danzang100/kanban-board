# CLI KANBAN BOARD
- Admins can create, delete, move tasks between statuses of to-do,  in-progress and completed, and also update priority of tasks to low, medium or high. Admins can also create tasks for users and must validate their tasks in order for the user task to be set to completed status.
- Users can move tasks between statuses of to-do, in-progress and to-validate, and also update their task priority. However, users cannot delete or add new tasks. Also completed tasks must be validated by an admin first.

# IMPLEMENTATION SO FAR
- Login/Signup for admins + users
